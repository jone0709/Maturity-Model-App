AI Security Maturity â€” Build & Run

Prerequisites
- Node.js (recommended LTS, e.g. 18+) and npm installed.

Install
1. Clone the repo (or open project folder)
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>

2. Install dependencies
   npm install

Run (development)
npm run dev

If you see issues:
- Ensure files in src/ are saved as UTF-8 (not UTF-16).
- If the dev server fails, check the terminal and browser DevTools Console for the first red error line; that usually indicates the cause.
